Description: Easily access vector data layers from Overture's open data themes:
             addresses, buildings, base, divisions, places, and transportation
             without downloading. Includes more than 3.7 billion features.
             This package uses cloud-native data access patterns through 'duckdb'
             and 'geoparquet' to stream subsets of data efficiently.
